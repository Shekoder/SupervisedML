# Student Score Prediction with Linear Regression

This project demonstrates the use of linear regression to predict student scores based on the number of study hours. The dataset is sourced from [this link](http://bit.ly/w-data).

## Project Overview

In this project, I used a simple linear regression model to predict the percentage score of a student based on the number of hours studied. The project involves:

1. **Loading the Dataset**: The dataset is loaded from a provided URL.
2. **Data Exploration**: Displaying the first few rows of the dataset.
3. **Feature Selection**: Using the number of study hours as the feature and the student score as the target variable.
4. **Model Training**: Splitting the data into training and testing sets, then training a linear regression model.
5. **Prediction**: Making predictions based on new data input.
6. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the model using mean absolute error and visualizing the regression line.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need Python and the following libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

Feel free to adjust the repository URL, installation commands, and other details as needed for your specific setup.
